  """
  Given a list of points in n-dimensional space represented as tuples and a query point, implement a function to find the k nearest neighbors to the query point using Euclidean distance.
  
  Example:
  Input:
  points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 1), (5, 6), (2, 3)], query_point = (2, 2), k = 3
  Output:
  [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 1)]
  Reasoning:
  The 3 closest points to (2, 2) are (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 1), so the output is [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 1)].
  
  Solution Explanation
  The key insight is to use numpy's vectorized operations to efficiently calculate distances between the query point and all data points simultaneously, then select the k smallest distances.
  
  Algorithm Steps:
  Convert to numpy arrays - Transform the input tuples into numpy arrays for vectorized operations Calculate distances - Use broadcasting to compute Euclidean distance from query point to all points at once Find k nearest - Use np.argsort() to get indices of points sorted by distance, then take first k Return as tuples - Convert the selected points back to tuple format
